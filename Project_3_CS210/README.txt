CS210 Journal Entry – Corner Grocery Project  

This project really showed me how useful writing classes can be. At first, I had a hard time getting started, but once I began creating classes, everything started to fall into place. It was surprising how naturally the code came together as I went. Compared to the messy, hard-to-follow code I used to write, this approach made everything much easier to track and manage.  

I structured the program with a collection class to manage the inventory, an item class to hold basic data, a menu class for handling user input, and the main function to tie everything together. Breaking it up this way made the logic much clearer, and I think I’ll be able to reuse a lot of this structure in future projects.  

One thing I want to improve is error handling. I included basic checks for menu input and file loading, but I know I could do more to prevent crashes or unexpected behavior. I also think I could refine the structure even further, but overall, I’m happy with how much more readable and organized this code is compared to what I used to write.  

I’ve been using VS Code consistently, and it has definitely helped with development. The biggest takeaway from this project is how much easier coding becomes when using well-structured classes. I feel like I’ve learned something that will make future projects more manageable, and I’m looking forward to applying these concepts again.
